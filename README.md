# Par XMLance

Python script that parses given dict into an XML string representation.

More extensive description will be added in the future. For now, feel free to peek
into the code for any info.

You can find `usage.py` in the repo that shows how the script is used.

PS: Yes, it's a cringe play on words with the french expression "par excellence".
